         It was agreed that Facilitators and Community Development Officers (CDOs) will be engaged for a maximum of 2 years
          of the project period for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of business plans for participating farmers 
          consisting of FUGs, out-growers, contract farmers and nucleus farms. 
          Capacity building will be provided for Facilitators, Services Providers, FUGs, 
          FCAs and other Producer Associations. Approval of the business plans that will be developed, 
          to take advantage of opportunities of market demand with strong linkage with private sector, 
          will be carried out at the cluster level.";
